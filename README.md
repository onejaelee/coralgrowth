Artificial vs Sunlight Comparison in various Hawaiian Coral Species

Plots growth data comparison in various Hawaiian coral species by genus and by light type to compare growth rates in corals
under LED Coral lights (labeled "Indoor") vs Sunlight (labeled "Outdoor"). Mass measurement suggests that artificial lights
prove to be quite beneficial once the corals are adapted to artificial light, which seems to be generalized across coral genus.

coral.py creates these graphs by extracting relevant information from the Excel file and converting it into a DataFrame
that allows it to easily create the graph using matplot.
